Strategy pattern is useful when we have multiple algorithms for specific task and we want our application to be flexible to chose any of the algorithm at runtime for specific task

The Strategy pattern is to be used where you want to choose the algorithm to use at runtime. A good use of the Strategy pattern would be saving files in different formats, running various sorting algorithms, or file compression.

The Strategy pattern provides a way to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable.
